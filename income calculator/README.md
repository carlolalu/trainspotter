# Income Calculator

The idea would be to build a very simple calculator to make predictions on the future. The development could be organised like this:
1. Calculator who is able to make predictions based on your current situations
2. Integrate qt-based gui (learn qt!)
3. Introduce functionalities for graph visualisation on long/short term predictions
4. 

Now a series of questions arises regarding the desing itself. Is it for example worthy to try to make this project OOP? A mathematician like me would dare to say no, but still to be seen.
