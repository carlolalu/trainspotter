# final goal: automatised chili pepper farm

The final goal should be to learn enough to build a personalised automatised farm with my rpi, in order to cultivate some chili peppers I found on amazon. The materials still needed are:
1. water pump 12V. On amazon for 15 euros
2. Growlights. The topic is complex, because I find the proper one, whihc emit all the light needed in the right range on amazon, but they are not customisable, you cannot connect them to the rpi to automatise the procedure, which instead is what I would like to do (the amazon ones still have a easy switch which can be set to 5 or 8h per day, but that is still not completely customisable with the rpi)

The real thing I need is KNOWLEDGE, and I have NONE. I need to read a bit of the book, to get a feeling, and then I can try to connect the water pump, which is the most important thing to automatise. I could also surrender and buy the lights on amazon, but I would very much prefer to find which led lamps I must buy (they must have a specific intensity in a certain light range, but this is easily found at the pics of the lamps of amazon itself), and connect them to the rpi as well.

The point is maybe this: I should start with the water pump, the rest comes afterwards. Incremental building. The problem is that the pepper do not grow without sun, and outseide my room is cold. inside there is almost no sun.
