# trainspotter

The movie 'Trainspotting' takes its name from the concept of 'trainspotter', meaning the person who decides to pass its time by watching the trains passing by and avoid to act. That is way the protagonist insists on the idea that they did not choose life, and in the end he 'converts' and states his famous speech 'Choose life!'.


This is meant to be a mono-repo of small projects to pass the time, without great ambitions.
